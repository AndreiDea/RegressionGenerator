# RegressionGenerator

## Intro
This is a program that creates a linear regression model of any dataset with compatible data. In the future, I will also include details about the gradient descent for the model.

## Instructions
User inputs a CSV file into a program, selects a set of columns that they would like inserted into linear regression,  the program generates a linear regression model based on those columns, and displays a plot of the data and the linear regression.

## More details
This program is currently only available on MacOS due to file system limitations. I am working on a Windows edition too, though, so stay
